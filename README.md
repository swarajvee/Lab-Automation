# Development of Open-Source Python Program for Lab Automation

## Project Overview
This project develops an open-source Python program to automate a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit (SMU) for performing I-V characterization of electronic components like silicon diodes and LEDs. The goal is to replace expensive proprietary software (e.g., LabVIEW) with a free, accessible, and customizable Python-based solution.

## Hardware Requirements
- Keithley 2400 SMU
- GPIB to USB Interface (e.g., Keithley KUSB-488B)
- Silicon Diode and LED (as DUTs)
- Computer with USB port

## Software Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Python packages: `pyvisa`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `time`, `os`, `csv`
- Keithley KUSB-488B Driver
- NI-VISA Library

## Installation Steps
1. Install Python 3.7 or later from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Install required Python packages: `pip install pyvisa numpy matplotlib`
3. Download and install the KUSB-488B driver from the Keithley website
4. Download and install the NI-VISA Library from the National Instruments website

## Connection Setup
1. Connect the GPIB interface to the Keithley 2400 SMU and the computer via USB
2. Connect the device under test (DUT) to the SMUâ€™s front terminals (HI and LO)
3. Verify the GPIB connection using the device manager (green indicator should light up)

## Usage
1. Run the Python script: `python keithley_iv_measurement.py`
2. Follow the prompts to enter compliance current, initial/maximum voltage, number of points, and component name
3. The script will perform a voltage sweep, measure current, save data to a CSV file, and plot the I-V curve

## Example Output
- CSV file: `I_V_Observation_<component_name>.csv`
- Plot: I-V characteristics graph

## Code Structure
- Import required libraries
- Establish GPIB connection
- Configure SMU settings
- Perform voltage sweep and current measurement
- Save and plot data
